This is POS - Point of Sale software. My family runs a business, and all this time i saw them writing down the payment note for our customer manually. 
There, I think, wouldn't it be easier if we just use software to print the payment note?

This software allows you to add your own menu and its category, input the customer order, and print their payment note.
It can also list all of the transactions that have been made and highlight some important data, such as total sales for the day, etc.

The main purpose of this software is to make us easier to handle and run our business due to a lot of customers that come to our place. 
This will be more efficient than writing down manually the payment note
